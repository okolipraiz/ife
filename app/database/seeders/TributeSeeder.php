                'message' => 'Bukkymi, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the elder’s club of 60 and above.
I still vividly remember our first meeting at the Scripture Union Fellowship at Rumuomasi, Port Harcourt on a certain Tuesday in September 1983. You were in the company of friend Sis. Ebele Okolugbo (now Mrs. Akure) and Bro. Philip Eto. You were a cute 21-year old on Nigeria Programme for new graduates called National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) 1983/84 set. I instantly felt something ‘love’ for you but I couldn’t nurse at that time for reason me and you know. We later grew to become friends serving the Lord in Children Ministry through Children Evangelism Fellowship, Rivers State Branch.
I proposed to marry you in March 1985 and you accepted September of the same year and on Saturday July 11, 1987, we married at the Methodist Church, Ijoku Sagamu and the rest is history as we normally say.
Our Union of 34 years has produced three biological lovely children (Ife, Ope, and Tomi all adults now) and many more children God has used us to raise over the years till date). We give God all the glory.
My dear, I know we argued a lot at the early part of our marriage (it has reduced drastically now) but we both know we can’t do without each other. I love you for who you are. You are a rare gem with a sense of devotion to God, dedication and sacrifice to family, and duty to mankind most especially amongst children and secondary school students.
Bukkymi, you have been a blessing to my life and my family; nucleus and extended. Virtually everyone speaks well of you as a good, sensible, understanding well brought child who is a home maker. You are simply fantastic as a wife. I thank God I have you.
Bukkymi, you have been a loving mother to your children ready to make sacrifice for the good of the children. I remember your trips from Lagos to Jos when the boys were at Airforce Military School using night bus (1998-2002). Your numerous trips to Crawford University, Igbesa, Bowen University, Iwo, United States International University at Nairobi. Kenya. Your trip to Cyprus, to USA named it. You follow the children like their shadows. I can remember how you sacrificed and abandoned your first work permit in the UK after your studies there (2001/2002) to come home to look after the children at Port Harcourt in 2003.
Bukkymi you a true mother indeed. You are real example of what Yorubas call ‘abiyamo too to’ and you shall ‘jere and jeun omo’ loruko Jesu amin’. We are all blessed to have you in our lives.
This tribute or appreciation of Bukkymi will be incomplete without a mention of the parents that brought you and your siblings to this world and properly raised you all.
To daddy, The Very Col (rtd) Matthew Oluwapamilerin Keripe, I say thank you. May your gentle and kind soul continue to Rest In Peace in bosom of your Lord since 2017.
And to mum Mrs. Beatrice Ibironke Keripe (Nee Akan) I also thank you. You were the best mum any child will wish for. Continue to Rest In Peace in the bosom of your Lord since 2012.
Your siblings: Margaret (Funke), Mireille, Shola, and Kayode also deserved a mention too. They have all rallied round you and us at different times to make a day like this possible and joyful. I greet you all and pray you will all celebrate 60 and beyond in Jesus name amen.
Bukkymi, I love you. And it is my prayers that the Lord continue to keep, uphold, strengthen, and grant you good health with long life. We shall both see our children’s children according God’s promise. We shall continue to be blessings to one another in Jesus name amen.
As you have turned 60, please slow down a little in your activities. May grace, love, peace, mercy, favour, and joy be multiplied unto you both now and all the days of your life in Jesus name amen. Congratulations.

I am cut unawares to do this write up. I have never given it a thought that I will do this someday.  I was given a time frame and I can tell you up to the time I sat to type I cannot stop looking at Patsy that is what we call her at home. <br>
Is really 60 years, have we being together for so long. I remember when our parents brought you and Margaret  home from England enroute Uganda so that you will have accustomed to African life.<br>
You started your schooling with Army Children School, your Dad a soldier and mummy a Nurse in Yaba Military Hospital.<br>
We moved to Akoka at Asani Street, close to Ilaje Bus stop. Anytime I passed the road the house is still standing there.<br>
Not minding the journey our parent moved because of the job, Benin, Kaduna, Port Harcourt, Ibadan then finally Lagos. This Makes you a Nigerian detribalised. You have your friends cut across the country.<br>
You moved to University of Benin, and so the journey of live for NYSC and then the marital live with LANRE OSHO.  When mummy called and said Dayo, Pasty is getting married I shouted. Excitement!.<br>
As I am writing I am watching the film of your marital journey from Enugu and finally at Sagamu because of Daddy's ancestry stand. I saw him with BIG TEAR DROPS!!! when the Osho's family will take you away. That is His hidden LOVE.<br>
We cannot but talk about your parents.  Mummy with a adorable, elegant but very strong personality that has been instilled in you. No wonder Patsy, you are now a WOMAN OF THE WORD. WITH THE STRENGTH OF DEBORAH.<br>
When the children started coming with Ifeoluwamakinde on the lead with others coming suit. all thanks were given to God.<br>
Your husband, the children have really taken very good care of you  MY SISTER. You will continue to enjoy the peace, love and God's protection in all areas of life"

You are everything to me and the reason I turned out to be the best version of me. I am wishing you a wonderful birthday. Happy 60th Birthday IYA OSHO ONE.'

She was an unassuming young lady who took her faith in God seriously; which we believe has made her such a caring mother and supportive wife.  Osaze remembers her commitment in children church in NCBC.  We (her family and ours) had excellent time together as members of the same house fellowship in Rumorolu. Bukky, welcome to proverbial 6th floor. Happy birthday"

Your life speaks volumes, and I am particularly grateful to God because knowing you has been a great learning experience for me.<br>
Through the years, you have demonstrated extremely rare qualities. You are quiet and brilliant.. reserved yet incredibly warm and hospitable. Soft-spoken but an excellent communicator.... Sensitive and at the same time, very objective....seeming to be frail, yet such a tower of great strength. <br>
Thanks Aunty for being so uniquely yourself. <br>
I have seen big dreams come alive because of your diligence, tenacity, and your 'can do' spirit...banking, baking, teaching and now owning and excellently running that school we prayed  for as prayer partners. I remember those periods with nostalgia and a deep sense of gratitude. <br>
Your love and commitment to both God and family are so evident, as is your devotion to children's ministry. <br>
Whether in sunshine or rain, you have demonstrated an unshakeable faith, and unwavering trust in the sovereignty of the God you know and serve so well.As you climb into a brand-new season of your life, I 'see' new horizons opening up for you, new territories to conquer, new dreams and visions to birth. <br>
'Not by power, not by might, but BY MY SPIRIT', says the Lord.<br>
Happy 60th ma."

She makes staffs and students feel more important, she'd do for you what you can't even imagine. Give generously but make a difference between good and bad; that make a sense. She's a leader with example, always put you on self - check whenever you see her in a classroom tutoring, full of impaction spirit, sacrifices her time, energy and resources to impact knowledge to her students and staffs. Wishing you heaven's best ma."

The tales of my success stories will be incomplete if you're not featured in it. You made them possible by being a mother and showcasing that motherly love to me. Little did you know, how much those gestures could impact a life. It, really, did impact my life and gave me hope again. I can go on and on, writing epistles and connecting the dots on how that benevolent act of granting me a tuition fee waiver, during my highschool days, made me.<br>
    I'll forever remain grateful.<br>
    I join the host of heaven this day to celebrate another year added to the magnificent life of yours and my earnest prayer is that you be granted longevity with refined health and the rewards of the seeds you've sown in love be showered bountifully on you. Happiest 60th birthday Mummy. You're loved and cherished!."
