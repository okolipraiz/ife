                Without her I won’t exist; very few times do we use those words in a literal sense, but since Mrs. Olubukunola Osho is my mum, it is literal in this case. By the time I met my mum she had already spent 27 years living on earth. Hence, it is impossible for me to give a first-person account of her early life; For this I have relied on her and other close friends and family for the early account of her life.

            Patsy’s secondary school experience was much more stable than her earlier years. She spent five years studying at St Teresa’s College, Ibadan. Even though she attended a Catholic school her parents were firmly Methodist. By the time she was 14, she dutifully goes through the Methodist confirmation experience. While at school she ends up studying the arts and social sciences, she liked reading and would hide herself in places just to get through a book. The arts and social sciences were a good fit for her. She loved the applied sciences too, ironically it was Mathematics she despised. She spent most of her time living with her parents, she had only boarded in school for the first two years in St Teresa’s College. Her parents had a farm and a poultry. It was a duty to check the poultry for eggs before going to school in the morning and also do some chores in the farm as soon as you get back home. Even as a Physiotherapist Matthew had some streaks of authoritarianism in him. But, at this time he was not just a Physiotherapist he was a captain in the Nigerian army. Chores must be done in military fashion, laziness and indiscipline was never going to be tolerated in Captain Matthew’s house, and Beatrice a nurse in the military herself agreed.

            She served her country as a Youth Corper between 1983 and 1984. She was posted to Rivers state, Nigeria. Her primary assignment was teaching Book Keeping, Accounting, and Economics to the students in Federal Government Girls' College, Abuloma, Nigeria. With all the experience gained volunteering at CEM, teaching it was already second nature to her.  She still found time to volunteer to work with the CEM branch in Port Harcourt; as she served her country, she still served God. It was during this time she met Lanre for the first time: the man who will eventually be her husband I read a scrap note in the house; In the note, my dad was trying to write about the experience of meeting Ms. Keripe for the first time. He wrote “the first time I saw you in September 83, I immediately fell in love with you”.

            <p>During this year they, in one of the Scripture Union meetings, they were paired for evangelism. They found a parent who cared less about the gospel they wanted to preach to her. However, she didn’t mind them evangelizing to her children. Bukky and Lanre shared the gospel with her children and eventually turned her house to a Bible Club from that on in 1983. Dad kept the club running even after she left. 
<br>
               <br> Bukky returned home at Kaduna after her National Youth Service in August 1983. Then, in Nigeria, it was still a relatively rare thing to have a Bachelor’s degree in the nineteen-eighties. So, almost as soon as she was done with her youth service, she got a job as a supervisor in Kaduna Cooperative Bank. Within two years the bank she worked for promoted her, and posted her to work in Lagos, presently the bank merged with other banks to form First City Monument Bank.

            The contact with Lanre was kept alive and a relationship has begun to develop. Lanre eventually made marriage proposal in writing from Port Harcourt in March ’85 and mum accepted in September of the same year.
<br>
    <br>        On Saturday 11th of July, 1987 Olubukunola Keripe married and changed her name to Olubukunola Osho. Within a year she gave birth to me. Dad still lived and worked in Port-Harcourt, mum still lived and worked in Lagos. A very unconventional arrangement especially in the eighties. By December of 1989 she gave birth to Ope. She eventually gave up her job at the bank to be with her husband. The previous arrangement didn’t appear sensible to them. In 1992 she got another job with North-South Bank Nigeria Plc at Port Harcourt.

        Compared to Lagos, Port Harcourt is an expensive place to live. “Omo major” as dad fondly calls her agreed to move the family to Lagos with the hope that dad will get a job in Lagos, Dad didn’t. For the first few years, she didn’t even bother applying to do any job there as she reckoned that there was no way to have a banking career raise two boys by herself effectively. In ’95 she gave birth to her last child, Tomi. As soon as mum settled into Lagos, she made and sold chinchin, zobo, and kunu right out of the living room of the house we lived, she had a fashion design shop where she also sold pastries etc; Captain Matthew didn’t raise no slouch. Three years after Tomi was born mum went back to school. She registered at the University of Lagos to earn a PGD in Education in 1999, later in 2014, she got a Master’s in Education Management from the same University. This time she was convinced she wanted to educate children for a living. As soon as she finished the Diploma Program she was thrown into the deep end; her first job in education required her to serve both as an Economics Teacher and as the Administrator of the Sunbeam Primary and Secondary Schools, Shasha, Lagos. She learnt so much in the time she worked at Sunbeam, she still refers to some of those experiences till this day

                Sometimes in 2001, Lanre in one of visits to the UK found out that there was need of teachers, and since mum was committed to educating children, she may as well do it in England. In the same month that the twin towers fell, mum landed in England to begin another teacher training program and guess her teaching subject, Mathematics! It was while in England she fell in love with Mathematics. By August 2002 she attained Qualified Teachers’ Status in England (an equivalent of the Post-graduate Diploma in Education). On completion od the programme, she got a job as Mathematics teacher and had her first one-year work permit for 2002/2003. however, within the academic year, she was back in Port Harcourt with the rest of the family by April 2003. She had fared better without the family than the family had fared without her, and as she has been known to do; she took one for the team and came back home abandoning the ‘almighty’ work permit. A full circle. On her return, she got a job at Royal Girls Academy, Port Harcourt, Bukky continued her work in children education. She taught Accounting, Economics and Mathematics at different times from 2003 to 2005.

                In September 2005, Olubukunola Osho started Antioch Royal College; it started with more teachers than there were students. Interestingly, the first student registered to her school was Tomi. While serving as school Proprietress/Administrator/Principal she taught Mathematics, Accounting, Economics and Geography and different times. It’s a running joke in our house that mum needs to write about her experience running Antioch Royal College for the last sixteen (16) years. Ope already has a title for it: “This School Business, Wetin You No Go See!”.   </p>

                Lanre was Baptist so my mum joined him in the Baptist Mission. They first were members of First Baptist Church, Diobu from when they married to 1989. Early in 1989, they became founding members of New Covenant Baptist Church (NCBC), Port Harcourt. We still worship at NCBC whenever we find ourselves in Port Harcourt. In 1994, the family became members of Providence Baptist church, and Triumphant Baptist church (TBC) in 1995. Till date the family still worships with TBC, Tomi was born dedicated in TBC. Through out her service at TBC she has been working with the Children Ministry of the Church. She would serve as the coordinator of TBC’s children ministry for eight (8) years, from 1997-2000 and from 2013-2016. Every year from 1997 to 2019 she has been involved in organization of Holiday Bible Camps for children between 6-15 years and lately with the Teenagers included.
