            Patsy’s secondary school experience was much more stable than her earlier years. She spent five years studying at St Teresa’s College, Nigeria. St Teresa’s College was a catholic school that boasted of being one of the sites Pope Paul IV visited while still a cardinal in 1962. Even though she attends a catholic school her parents were firmly Methodist. Matthew was already a layman preacher in the Methodist church since their time in England. By the time she was 14, she dutifully goes through the Methodist confirmation experience. While at school she ends up studying the arts and social sciences,
             she liked reading and would hide herself in places just to get through a book. The arts and social sciences were a good fit for her. She loved the applied sciences too, ironically it was mathematics she despised. She spent most of her time living with her parents, she had only boarded in school for 
             the first two years in St Teresa’s College. Her parents had a farm and a poultry. It was a duty to check the poultry for eggs before going to school in the morning and also do some chores in the farm as soon as you get back home. Even as a nurse Matthew had some streaks of authoritarianism in him. But, at this time he was not just a nurse he was a captain in the Nigerian army. Chores must be done in military fashion, laziness and indiscipline was never going to be tolerated in Captain Matthew’s house, and Beatrice a military nurse herself agreed.

            <p>In ’78 it was time for her to do her A levels. She completed the A levels exams at Queen School Ibadan, Nigeria by 1979. She was eighteen (18) years old when it was time to enter the university. At that time only thirteen (1Without her I won’t exist; very few times do we use those words in a literal sense, but since Mrs. Olubukunola Osho is my mum, it is literal in this case. By the time I met my mum she had already spent 27 years living on earth. Hence, it is impossible for me to give a first-person account of her early life; For this I have relied on her and other close friends and family for the early account of her life.

            3 universities existed in Nigeria. Barring the two years she spent in boarding house, my mum had spent all her life living with her parents. She was not about to go to University of Ibadan to relive the Captain Matthew experience. Like most people her age she wanted to go to a university far from home she eventually chose University of Benin. It was relatively far from home and it was a fairly new university and they were the only university at the time with a computer department. In 1979 computers where a fairly new concept. She spent four (4) years in university studying business administration. While at school she was a member of scripture union and also volunteered in a Christian none profit organization called children evangelism ministry (CEM). She mostly volunteered to teach children the bible. She did not know at the time, but she would eventually meet her husband through ministry. She graduated from University of Benin magna cum laude in 1983. Her diploma reads “Olubukunola Patricia Keripe having satisfied all the requirements of the University and passed the prescribed examinations held in July 1983 has been admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Science (Business Administration)”. 
            She served her country as a youth corper between 1983 and 1984. She was posted to Rivers state, Nigeria. Her primary assignment was teaching book keeping, accounting, and economics to the students in Federal Government Girls' College, Abuloma, Nigeria. With all the experience gained volunteering at CEM teaching was already second nature to her.  She still found time to volunteer for the CEM branch in port-harcourt; as she served her country, she still served God. It was during this time she met Lanre: the man who will eventually be her husband for the first time. I read a scrap note in the house; In the note, my dad was trying to write about the experience of meet Ms. Keripe for the first time. He wrote “the first time I saw you in September 83, I immediately fell in love with you”.     
            <br>
            <p>In Nigeria, it was still a relatively rear thing to have a Bachelor’s degree in the nineteen-eighties. So, almost as soon as she was done with her youth service, she got a job as a supervisor in Kaduna Cooperative Bank. Within two years the bank she worked for promoted her, and posted her to work in Lagos, presently the bank is known as First City Monument Bank. Even after she finished the youth service, Lanre and Bukky kept in touch. They had grown close in the one year that she served in Rivers state. They where both paired for evangelism one day and they found a parent who cared less about the gospel they wanted to preach to her. However, she didn’t mind them evangelizing to her children. They turned her house to a bible club; Dad kept the club running even after she left.  Lanre proposed in March ’85 mum accepted in September.

            On Saturday 11th of July, 1987 Olubukunola Keripe agreed to change her name to Olubukunola Osho. Within a year she gave birth to me. Dad still lived and worked in port-harcourt, mum still lived and worked in Lagos. A very unconventional arrangement especially in the eighties. By December of 1989 she gave birth to Ope. She eventually gave up her job at the bank to be with her husband. The previous arrangement didn’t appear sensible for a young couple. In 1991 she got another job with North-South Bank Nigeria Plc. In the 60 years that she has lived this was the worst job she ever did. The hours were long and the pay was barely enough for transport. She left after two (2) grueling years. Central Bank of Nigeria would later revoke the license of North-South Bank Nigeria Plc for its inability to honor its obligations to its customers.

            Compared to Lagos, Port Harcourt is an expensive place to live. “Omo major” as dad fondly calls her agreed to move the family to Lagos with the hope that dad will get a job in Lagos, Dad didn’t. She didn’t even bother applying to any job there was no way to have any banking career raising two boys by herself. In ’95 she gave birth to her last child, Tomi. As soon as mum settled into Lagos, she was selling zobo and kunu right out of the living room of the house we lived, she had a fashion design shop where she also sold pastry; Captain Matthew didn’t raise no slouch. Three years after Tomi was born mum went back to school. She registered at the University of Lagos to earn a PG. D in Education. This time she was convinced she wanted to educate children for a living. As soon as she finished the diploma program she was thrown into the deep end; her first job in education required her to serve both as an economics teacher and as the administrator of the Sunbeam primary and secondary schools. She learnt so much in the time she worked at Sunbeam, she still refers to some of those experiences till this day.

            Lanre had found out England was in need of teachers, and since mum was committed to educating children, she may as well do it in England. In the same month that the twin towers fell mum landed in England to begin her teacher training program. It was while in England she fell in love with mathematics.  By august 2002 she attained qualified teachers’ status in England, however, by the next year she was back in Port Harcourt with the rest of the family. She had fared better without the family than the family had fared without her, and as she has been known to do; she took one for the team and came back home. A full circle. Bukky continued her work in children education, she taught accounting, economics and mathematics at Royal Girls Academy, Port Harcourt from 2003 to 2005.

            In September 2005, Olubukunola Osho started Antioch Royal College; it started with more teachers than there were students. Interestingly, the first student registered to her school was Tomi. It’s a running joke in our house that mum needs to write about her experience running Antioch Royal College for the last sixteen (16) years. Ope already has a title for it: “This School business, wetin you no go see!”. In the sixty (60) years of her life, my mum has always lived with the clarity that life is about service, and satisfaction is only obtained through responsibility.
